          "text": "I appreciate your candid feedback. It sounds like Mr. Kabuz's presentation didn't meet your expectations as it was more focused on Greece rather than learning programming, which was your area of interest. \n\nTo make sure I understand correctly, were you expecting the forum to have a greater focus on technical aspects related to Wealth Management like programming? Your detailed feedback is invaluable and will greatly assist us in refining the selection and specifics of our sessions and speakers for future events.\n\nDo you have any other comments or suggestions about the diverse quality of speakers, the conference agenda, logistics, venue, or communication from the organizers?",
